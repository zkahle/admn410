<h3>Our Policies</h3>

	<b>Financing</b>
	<p>	We offer many financing options such as "Pay in Four" with little interest. But, this shouldn't be needed since the Dome Fishing Rod comes at the low price of only <b>$34.99!</b> 
	</p>

<br/>
	<b>Delivery</b>
	<p> The shipping cost is calculated at checkout, but we offer delivery across the world. The Glass Dome Fishing Rod is an innovative technology unheard of before that will change the way we view recreational fishing. It is worth your investment for our future generations.

	<b>Return Policies</b>
	<p>	We offer a <b>30 Day Warranty</b> for replacement on all our products. For example, if the glass seal isn't working properly, contact us before the end of the warranty period and we will replace the dome free of charge.
